## Overview

**FYND-TASK** demonstrates a practical application of AI for automating feedback collection and analysis, and explores LLM-based automatic sentiment/rating prediction for review data.

This repository consists of:
- **A Streamlit web app**: Multi-dashboard system for submitting and managing ratings/reviews, powered by AI-generated replies, summaries, and actions.
- **A Jupyter Notebook**: Experiments with prompt engineering & LLM APIs to predict Yelp review star ratings and evaluate multiple approaches.

---

## Features

### Web App
- User Dashboard: Submit a rating & review, get an instant AI-generated friendly reply.
- Admin Dashboard: View all submissions, get on-demand AI summaries and recommended next actions per review.
- Analytics: See aggregate rating metrics and recent reviews.
- All data stored securely in CSV file.

### LLM Experiment Notebook
- Loads a sample of Yelp reviews.
- Three prompt designs for LLM-based automated rating prediction.
- Automated collection & evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix plots) for each prompt type.

---

## Demo App: AI Feedback System

- **Path**: `streamlit_app.py`
- **How it works**:
    - Uses Perplexity's sonar-pro model (API required) for AI replies and summaries.
    - Ratings and reviews are stored in a local CSV.
    - Admin tab enables summary/action generation and bulk review.
- **To run**:
    1. Install requirements.
    2. Set the `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` environment variable or add it to Streamlit secrets.
    3. Launch with `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.

## Notebook: LLM Rating Experiments

- **Path**: `fynd_task.ipynb`
- **What it does**:
    - Loads review text & rating stars from a Yelp dataset sample.
    - Defines several prompt engineering strategies for querying LLMs to predict rating.
    - Automates accuracy/comparative analysis for zero-shot, contextual, and "self-evaluation" styles.
    - Plots diagnostic confusion matrices and reports metrics.
